This application is a simplified replication of bit.ly, but geared toward those
who want to track the clicks on their shared URLs. As implemented, this app
allows the user to create a bookmark as public or private. All public bookmarks
for all users are available to the general public on the homepage.

Major new learning includes:
-- Use of hashids
-- Capturing URLs and redirecting
-- Counting clicks
-- Pagination


Required features (plus the "Hard Mode" components of public/private):

--User can save a URL as a bookmark with a title and an optional description.

--User can see all of the bookmarks in reverse chronological order.

--User can access a bookmark through a URL with a short code, allowing them to
share bookmarks.

--When a user accesses a bookmark, the access is recorded with the bookmark and
the timestamp.

--Users can create an account, log in, and log out.

--A logged in user can create, edit, and create bookmarks that are tied to themselves.

--A logged in user can not edit or delete a bookmark created by another user.

--Be able to update and delete existing bookmarks
